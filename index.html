          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the header section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>The rules only apply to the page they're on.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>Margin property acts like a margin in a word processing document.</li>
          <li>Padding adds space around the content inside the element</li>
          <li>Can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, to allow it to affect both selectors.</li>
          <li>DRY, or do not repeat yourself, is a principle that reuses or shares pieces of code to reduce the number of lines of code.</li>
          <li>To view CSS changes, must link the CSS file to the HTML file.</li>
